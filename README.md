## Intro to web basics 
###### start here if you have 0 experience

This tutorial serves as a guide to create a responsive static website, one that
does not load new content. Static websites only display text and images and are
considered the most basic type of websites. These are coded in HTML and CSS (and JavaScript if you wanna be fancy) and show
the same information to every user, unlike sites such as Facebook, Amazon and Twitter (or any real web application), which
constantly update and show new/different content to each user.

A responsive website is one that changes depending on what kind of device is accessing
it. For example, a website should look different if a phone is accessing it, compared to a
tablet, a laptop and a desktop. To build a responsive website, we will be using Twitter
Bootstrap, a CSS framework created by Twitter to do this easily.

##### A little about website structure

From the most basic level, websites are composed of HTML (HyperText Markup
Language) along with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling your website. HTML is a markup
language (not a programming language) that defines the structure of the webpage. It is
basically the skeleton of a website. HTML uses tags to declare certain elements in a
webpage. For instance a header element uses an “h1” tag (shown below) to tell the
browser that a header is in between the tags. It will then render any text between the
opening and closing tags in a large and bold manner.

```html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

Common HTML tags include `<h1>`, `<img>`, `<body>`, `<p>` `<a>`, and
`<div>`. Which respectively denote a heading, an image, the body of a webpage,
paragraph text, a link, and a sectional division.
